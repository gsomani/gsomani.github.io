  too much rumination is a bug. It needs to be eliminated, I have always been
  interested in science and maths. Example of this whle my Vipassana practice, I
  found that shortest path on a sphere is a geodesic and thought about CRC
  coding scheme. Also I was thinking about Sun motion and time on earth. This
  was one of the beautiful things. I have also thought about starting
  crystallography group in IIT BHU. Also I was solving putnam problems. I like
  3blue1brown videos. I like mathematics from childhood.
