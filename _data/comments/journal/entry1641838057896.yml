  I was very happy to attend Pawan's class and had some good insights during it.
  Some thought provoking while finding the lowest surface energy. Also during my
  M.tech. project, I was interested in doing many simulations to understand what
  is happening in SDD. May be God give me power to work hard 14 hours a day
  every day from now on. I hope I can do better in coming years along with
  taking care of my health.
