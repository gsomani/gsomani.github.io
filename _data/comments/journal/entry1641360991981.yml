message: "1) Don't waste time  in regret. What matters is just your present and how you move into the future with it. Just don't lose track of your priorities and waste time in unuseful thinking.\r\n\r\n2) Set your priorities straight.\r\n\r\n3) Clean your house for one hour daily from now on as you have to move \r\n\r\n4) The notion of your present self is what think and do. Actually this is physically true that you are changing everyday. The psychological continuity is because of your association with your memories and your ego. Once your ego dissolves, you would not think of the same way\r\n\r\n5) Lets do your duties and be curious and not be deeply sad in regret."
