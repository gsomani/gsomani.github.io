message: >-
  try to understand relation between rain probability and relative humidiy and
  temperature. Idea is to clausius clayperon equation to compute saturation
  vapor pressure and then use relative humidity to compute actual vapor pressure
  and then check the temperature at which actual vapor pressure would cause rain
  and hence give you the probability of rain
